Final project
My project was approved by Laurel Hilger
The goal of my project was to take a previous assignment that I have already done, but which was hard coded, and make it much easier to run although the coding process was a lot more involved than it was initially. 
The initial code, which is the second function of this code was written by hard coding the variables that are known from the problem, then defining all the components of it using other variables. The part that is labeled f_alpha_gamma is the dummy code that is used to find the loop that is being used to define the variables. The for loop is then used to actually solve the matrix that was input, with the variables that are above the matrix just being used to clean up the matrix and make it easier to read and the variables below being the variables that are actually being solved for. What is new is the first function that allows the user to input the variables instead of them being hard coded. 
The text boxes are just used to label the edit boxes which is where the user will put in the known values. 
The values that are input into the edit boxes are then defined in the second function with the command str2double converting them from the string that is input into the edit boxes into actual numbers so that the second function is actually able to run. The second function is then called backed into the first function using a push button command that will actually solve the equation. The goal of the other callback function is to convert the values into an excel file using a .csv command, which is then also called back to the main function again using a push button command to actually execute it, however I am not sure how to get it to automatically open so the user will have to manually open it using the folder bar on the side of the screen, though it does display the values that were solved for correctly. 
	The first problem that I had was the everything in the pop up were overlapping each other , this problem was easy to fix in that all that had to be done was to move the location of the text and edit files around so that the positions weren’t overlapping and so that is also looked nice and organized. The biggest problems that I ran into while coding this was after defining everything when I would run it the box would pop up and I was able to press the solve button, but after pressing the solve button it would pop up the error of too many input variables. This problem was solved for by adding a ~,~ to the input of the second function. The next problem that I ran into was the solve button not displaying my answers. This problem was fixed by adding a third function that’s only job was to match the output to the vendor that I was calling in the first function that matched the push button. 
	The goal of this final project was to automate something that went along with either a hobby or something tied to my major. So, with that in mind I decided to automate a force analysis problem. In the future I can use GUIs again to automate more complicated processes whether that be other codes that I have written in the past that are hard coded and changing that from being hard coded to where I just have to input the values that I want and push a solve button or taking other complex problems and instead of taking the time to try and do them by hand write up a code that is more easily able to solve them. My hobbies include music, video games, movies, and sports so I believe that a GUI might be able to help me keep track of athletes and their stats for easily.
