# FinalProject
To run the code all that is needed is to first push the run button to get the
GUI to pop up once it pops up you need to fill in the information in each box as
indicated next to the box. The goal of this problem is to easily be able to solve
a force analysis problem for kinematics, so all the values needed should be given in
the problem, but it should be able to solve for any number values that the user
inputs, just by pushing the solve button after filling in each edit box. The other
button turns the values into a .csv file that must be opened by pushing the force
